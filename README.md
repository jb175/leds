# LED Lighting Project Synchronized with Music

This project aims to create a LED lighting system capable of illuminating in sync with music and controllable via a master unit. The goal is to light up large spaces, such as an old barn, with custom animations. The project integrates aspects of electronics development, software (ESP32 and control via a mobile/web application), and 3D printing for the enclosure.

## Main Features

- **LED Animation Control**: Sync with music or pre-programmed animations.
- **Modular System**: Expandable to multiple units in a network.
- **Control via Web/Mobile Interface**: Adjust animations remotely.
- **3D Printed Enclosure**: Custom casing for the LED boxes.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several sections, each detailed in a separate document:

1. [Electronic Circuit and Component List](docs/electronics.md)
2. [ESP32 Development (LED Animations)](docs/esp32_dev.md)
3. [Web and Mobile Control Interface](docs/web_control.md)
4. [3D Printed LED Enclosure](docs/3d_print.md)

## Project Roadmap

Next steps include:
- Adding new animations and testing in real environments (large spaces).
- Optimizing control via the web and synchronizing multiple units.
- Improving 3D printed enclosures for robustness and modularity.
